The 90's were a wild time in the business of bikes. Full suspension has just entered the MTB world and V-brakes (introduced 1995) have rovolutionized the braking performance. The popularity of mountain bikes has slipped through to other genres, giving birth to the cross bike and a **Giant X-2000** - a bike made for cruising the roads and handling milder mountains, a bike that 20 years later would be given drop bars and be called _gravel_.

== X-2000 - The Giant Cross Bike

Giant X-2000 frame is similar to the other models of the 1996 catalog, the shape of the Touring, Cabriolet, Tourer, Trooper, Squadron and X-2000 seem to be all the same. A closer look will reveal that X-2000 differs in cable routing - the top tube is home to the rear break, rear and front derailleur cables, and none are passed under the bottom bracked, which is standard on the other frames. This is a common practice borrowed from the MTB models, routing the cables at the top of the bike keeps them away from the mud. The boxer fork is another unique feature, only brought to the X-2000, Cabriolet and the Trooper, these days it became sort of a holy grail, due to it's rarity and estethics clearly distinct from a regular uni fork.

== X-2000 as a Modern Gravel

The original bike colors inspired me to chose mostly black components, as the deore LX groupset was black, which was still unusual in the 90's - black was only slowly getting introduced to the market after decades of the silver domination. I really wanted to empasise the pink the shade of the _GIANT_  decals on the down tube with the bar tape, however finding an exact same shade of pink turned out impossible and the colors slightly differ. 

=== The Drivetrain 

The new configuration also features an interesting, mixed drive train. The old Deore crankset originally came with 24/34/44 chainrings, my modification involved removing the middle ring and replacing it with the outer one. That sounds crazy risky, something that no official shimano compatibility table would ever advised, but it worked - not perfectly.. but it id. What's wrong about it will ask? Well, the outer ring has to remain in the outer orientation, to keep the chain pop on it nicely, which also means that when mounted in the middle position, the crank bolts are not fully hidden in the chainring. The other issue is related to the chain width and the fact that the old crank was made for 8s chain, whilst the new setup is 10s with a much thinner chain. During the shifts a 10s chain could get trapped in the space between the chainrings. I got this solved in a simple way, by putting two spacers on the outer side of the big chainring.
